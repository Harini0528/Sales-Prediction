This sample dataset is designed to work directly with the sales prediction script I provided earlier. Let me break down the columns:

advertising_spend: Amount spent on advertising (in dollars)
marketing_budget: Total marketing budget (in dollars)
num_products: Number of products offered
store_location: Store location ID (categorical)
seasonal_factor: Seasonal impact on sales (1.0 is baseline)
economic_indicator: Economic conditions factor
total_sales: Target variable (sales amount)
