This Python script provides a comprehensive approach to sales prediction using machine learning. Here's a breakdown of the key components:

Data Preprocessing:
Loads data from a CSV file
Handles missing values
Prepares features and target variable

Model Training:
Uses Random Forest Regressor
Splits data into training and testing sets
Scales features using StandardScaler
Trains the model with hyperparameter tuning

Model Evaluation:
Calculates Mean Squared Error (MSE)
Calculates Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
Computes R-squared score

Visualization:
Creates a scatter plot of actual vs. predicted sales
Helps in visually assessing model performance

Future Predictions:
Includes a function to predict sales for new data points


Important Notes:
Replace 'sales_data.csv' with the path to your actual sales dataset
Modify the features list in load_and_preprocess_data() to match your specific dataset columns
The script assumes a CSV file with columns for various features and total sales
